## 📖 About
The Neural Extraction Framework is a specialized repository under the DBpedia project focused on advancing information extraction using neural networks and large language models. This framework complements DBpedia's traditional extraction methods by providing state-of-the-art neural approaches for extracting structured knowledge from unstructured text.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **Neural-based Triple Extraction**: Extract RDF triples using language models
- **Multi-language Support**: Specialized pipelines for various languages (English, Hindi, etc.)
- **Semantic Web Integration**: RDF/SPARQL compatible outputs
- **Evaluation Frameworks**: Benchmarking tools for IE performance

## 🗣️ Supported Languages

- 🇬🇧 English (no suffix)
- 🇮🇳 Hindi (`_H` suffix)

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Git

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dbpedia/neural-extraction-framework.git
cd neural-extraction-framework

# Navigate to specific GSoC project
cd GSoC25_H  # Example: Hindi Chapter

# Follow project-specific setup
# Each directory has its own README with detailed instructions
```

> **Important**: Each GSoC project has unique dependencies and setup requirements. Always refer to the README in the specific project directory.

## 🎓 Project Structure

Each GSoC directory typically contains:

- `README.md` - Project-specific documentation
- `src/` - Source code and implementations
- `data/` - Datasets and benchmarks
- `models/` - Trained models or model configurations
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
